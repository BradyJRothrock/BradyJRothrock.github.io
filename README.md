## Welcome to my portfolio

<img src="assets/images/Brady.jpg" width="300" height="420">

I joined Sprint in 2012, which has now merged with T-Mobile, and currently works as a Data Scientist within the Internal Audit Technology Team. I perform and guides data analytics projects in audit areas spanning retail, finance, operations, and enterprise risk management.

Prior to joining Sprint, I obtained my Certified Public Account (CPA) license and Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE) designation before entering the field of data analysis. I serve as a local user group leader for an audit industry specific analytics tool, as well as the Technology Director for the Kansas City Association of Certified Fraud Examiners. In my spare time I spend time with my family, experiment with Machine Learning models, and research Sabermetrics (the application of statistical analysis to baseball data).
